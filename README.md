Provide pictures dataset and scripts to create Chinese Fairy Stories for Elementary Students based on LLMs.

The creation of original children's literature has always been a challenging aspect of Chinese children's literature. Research shows that children's fairy tales play a crucial role in various aspects of child development, including stimulating imagination, aiding cognitive and language development, fostering emotional and moral growth, cultivating an interest in reading, enhancing concentration, conveying and promoting cultural traditions and values, improving logical thinking and analytical skills, and reducing stress

Artificial intelligence presents new possibilities to address these challenges. By analyzing global narrative structures and cultural motifs, AI can support plot innovation and cross-cultural creativity. It also enables age-appropriate language refinement and facilitates immersive storytelling through interactive technologies. Rather than replacing human creativity, AI serves as a tool to liberate authors from technical constraints, allowing them to focus on meaningful local themes—such as childhood experiences across rural and urban settings—and to craft stories that combine emotional depth with cultural authenticity.

Therefore, if large language models can assist human authors in generating high-quality children's fairy tales, they can significantly contribute to children's language education and aesthetic development. 

We create a story picture dataset, consisting of 543 story pictures, which were scraped from Chinese fairy tale websites. 

Based on the dataset above, we employed five multimodal large language models (ChatGPT-4.0 and four open-source MLLMs including VisCPM, VCLA, VisualGLM and QWen-VL) that support Chinese to generate a unique Chinese fairy tale for each image. 

Using our project, you can conduct studies on evaluating MLLM-generated stories and human-written stories and analysis the differences.
